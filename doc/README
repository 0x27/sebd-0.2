sebd v0.1 (simple encrypted backdoor)

sebd is another linux backdoor.

what does sebd provide:
- a raw sniffer
- aes encrypted shell
- full tty/pty support
- connect back (bypass moust of the firewall's)
- does not open a port
- you can log in on any opened port
- cleans the logs (wipes out the ip from where the sniffer received the password)
- tcpd function (if the pasword is from an ip that isn't in the list -> no shell)
- password is encrypted with DES (hardcoded only in the server binary)

usage:

on the server host run: ./sebd
on the client host run: ./client -h host|ip -d port
